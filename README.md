<h1>Simplified Cryptographic Applications</h1>

 
<h2>Description</h2>
The project consist to write three independent programs in three separate directories: a key generation program, a sender's program, and a receiver's program, to implement the public-key encrypted message and its authentic digital digest. X represents the sender and Y represents the receiver. In the sender's program in the directory "Sender", we calculate RSA-En ky+(AES-ENkxy((SHA256(M))||M). to test the program, the corresponding key file need to be copied here from the directory "KeyGen". then we read the information on the keys to be used in this program from the key files and generate Ky+ and Kxy.
